The Julia REPL code blocks look something like the following:

  julia> function foo(x)
             x + 1
         end
  foo (generic function with 1 method)

They start on a new line with "julia>". Usually there should also be a space after this, but
we also allow the code to start right after the > character. The code may run over multiple
lines, but the additional lines must start with six spaces (i.e. be indented to match
"julia>"). The rest of the code is assumed to be output from the executed code and will be
left un-highlighted.

Using simply spaces to identify line continuations may get a false-positive if the output
also prints out six spaces, but such cases should be rare.
